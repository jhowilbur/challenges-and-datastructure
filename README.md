# challenges - Models

I explain the main learning and training approaches.

The topics are separated by folders to facilitate explanations, in each folder there is a source code with comments showing the steps and ideas behind all challenges.

I made the explanations as simple as possible.

Any questions, just contact me:

### Details and types of data structure

You can see a types of datas structures writing in Java Code in resources.datastructure package.

In that package I'm including a lot of types models and usable structures in Java.

#### More details about data structure package

#### Trees

A binary tree is a recursive data structure where each node can have 2 children at most.

A common type of binary tree is a binary search tree, in which every node has a value that is greater than or 
equal to the node values in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the node values in the right sub-tree.
